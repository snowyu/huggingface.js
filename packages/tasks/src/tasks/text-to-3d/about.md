## Use Cases

Text-to-3D models can be used in a wide variety applications that require 3D, such as games, animation, design, architecture, engineering, marketing, and more.

This task is similar to the [image-to-3d](https://huggingface.co/tasks/image-to-3d) task, but takes text input instead of image input. In practice, this is often equivalent to a combination of [text-to-image](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-to-image) and [image-to-3d](https://huggingface.co/tasks/image-to-3d).

### Generating Meshes

Meshes are the standard representation of 3D in industry.

### Generating Gaussian Splats

[Gaussian Splatting](https://huggingface.co/blog/gaussian-splatting) is a rendering technique that represents scenes as fuzzy points.
